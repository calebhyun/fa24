> Skills and tools for building practical data science projects, along with their theoretical underpinnings. `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `BeautifulSoup`, and Jupyter Notebooks, and also the math behind loss functions, gradient descent, linear and logistic regression, and other key ideas in machine learning.

This course will train students to use industry-standard tools to solve real-world problems, while giving them an understanding of how these tools work under the hood. After taking this course, students will be prepared to build data science portfolios, participate in research across campus, and succeed in data science internships.

The course will roughly be split in two halves; while the topics in it may overlap with other existing courses, it will take a very practical approach.

### Credit

This course is worth 4 credits, and counts for the following major requirements:
- Computer Science: Upper-Level CS (ULCS) Elective
- Data Science: Advanced Technical Elective or Application Elective
- Electrical Engineering: Flexible Technical Elective


### Prerequisites

The course is open to students from all majors.

The enforced prerequisites are discrete math (EECS 203), programming (EECS 280), calculus I, calculus II, and linear algebra. A probability and statistics course is an advisory prerequisite. Options include DATASCI 101, STATS 206, STATS 250, STATS 280, STATS 412, IOE 265, or ECON 451.

**All students, especially those who haven't taken a linear algebra course, should work through [LARDS: Linear Algebra Review for Data Science](lin-alg) before the semester starts.**

## Getting Started

The course website, [practicaldsc.org](https://practicaldsc.org), will contain links to all
course content. There are also a few things you'll need to do to get set up.

### Websites

You'll need to make accounts on the following sites:

- **Ed:** We‚Äôll be using Ed as our course message and discussion board. (Think of Ed as a replacement to Piazza.) More
  details are in the [Communication](#communication) section below. If you
  didn‚Äôt already get an invitation to our Ed course, [sign up
  here](https://edstem.org/us/join/PKnfHw).

- **Gradescope:** You‚Äôll submit all assignments to
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/823979). This is where all of
  your grades will live as well. Most of the assignments will be coding
  assignments. Parts of these assignments will be manually graded, but most of
  them will be autograded. You should have received an email invitation for
  Gradescope, but if not please let us know as soon as possible (preferably via
  Ed). Note that we will not be using the EECS-specific "Autograder" platform.

- **GitHub:** You will access all course content (lecture slides and assignments) by _pulling_ our course GitHub repository. That repo
  is here:
  [github.com/practicaldsc/fa24](https://github.com/practicaldsc/fa24). Don't worry if you've never used Git before ‚Äì the [‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup](../env-setup) page will walk you through all of the necessary steps.
  <!-- For the most part, you won't need to _push_ anything to GitHub, though if and when you do, we will provide sufficient guidance. -->

Note that we will **not** be using Canvas for anything this quarter (so please don't try and send us messages on Canvas!).

### Development Environment

As soon as you are able to, go follow the steps in the [Environment Setup
Support](../env-setup) page of the course website to set up your programming
environment for the course. Discussion 1 will be dedicated to making sure you've followed these steps.

### Forms

Please fill out the [TODO: Welcome Survey](#) to tell us a bit more about yourself and tell us if you need an alternate exam.

## Communication

This quarter, we‚Äôll be using Ed as our course message board. You will be added
to Ed automatically; use the invite link in the section above if you weren't
added.

If you have a question about anything to do with the course ‚Äî if you‚Äôre stuck
on a problem, didn‚Äôt understand something from lecture, want clarification on
course logistics, or just have a general question about data science ‚Äî you can
make a post on Ed. We only ask that if your question includes some or all of an
answer (even if you‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôs right), please make your post private so
that others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously to other students if
you prefer.

Course staff will regularly check Ed and try to answer any questions that you
have. You‚Äôre also encouraged to answer questions asked by other students.
Explaining something is a great way to solidify your understanding of it!

**Please don‚Äôt email individual staff members, just make a private or public Ed
post instead.**
